Music Store Data Analysis Project using SQL
Project Overview
The Music Store Data Analysis Project aims to explore and analyze data from a music store database using SQL queries. This project addresses various problems ranging from identifying top employees and customers to determining popular music genres and high-revenue cities. The analysis is divided into three levels of difficulty: easy, intermediate, and advanced. Each level tackles different aspects of the data to provide valuable insights into the music store's operations and customer preferences.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of several tables related to the music store's operations, including:

employee: Details about employees, including their job titles and levels.
invoice: Information about invoices, including billing details and total amounts.
customer: Customer information such as names and email addresses.
invoice_line: Details of each item included in an invoice.
track: Information about individual tracks, including genre and album details.
album: Album details including the artist.
artist: Information about artists.
genre: Genre information for tracks.
The project is divided into three categories of problems - easy, intermediate, and advanced - each 
addressing different aspects of the data.
Easy Problems and Solutions: 
Q1)Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
Q2)Which countries have the most Invoices?
Q3)What are top 3 values of total invoice?
Q4)Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music 
Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that has 
the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals. 
Q5)Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be 
declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most 
money. 
Intermediate Problems and Solutions:
Q1)Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music 
listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.
Q2)Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a 
query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands. 
Q3) Return all the track names that have a song length longer than  the average song 
length. Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with 
the longest songs listed  first. 
Advanced Problems and Solutions:
Q1)Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return 
customer name, artist name and total spent. 
Q2) We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine 
the most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query 
that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum 
number of purchases is shared return all Genres. 
Q3) Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for 
each country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how 
much they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all 
customers who spent this amount. 
Conclusion 
The Music Store Data Analysis Project demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting valuable insights 
from a relational database. By addressing a variety of problems at different difficulty levels, the 
project provides a comprehensive analysis of the music store's data, helping to identify key 
employees, top customers, popular music genres, and more. These insights can be used to make 
informed business decisions and strategize future marketing efforts.
